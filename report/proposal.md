# Project Description
## Probelm Statement and Motivation
The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

I think it is important for AI to be able to detect hate speech. Social media companies are not doing a good job keeping hate from their sites. I want to explore how well a SOTA NLP model will be able to detect hate speech using just open source projects and a small dataset.

## Introduction and Description of Data
The dataset is 31,962 tweets labeled as racist/sexist or not. Sentiment analysis is a challenging task.
